<div class="main">

## Overview

In this chapter, You will disperse the particles.<>
This chapter is not enough to make cool effects, but you can learn the basic operation of Effekseer.
Based on the knowledge learned in this chapter, you will create a cool effect in the next chapter.
Therefore, let's understand firmly.

<div align="center">

<p>Effects created in this chapter</p>
</div>

## <s>Edit location</s>
   
### <s>Edit initial placement position</s>

Currently, particles are shown in the center. Let's move this particle from the center.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/01_square.png">
<p>Shown in the center</p>
</div>

First, click "Node" in the <s>"node tree"</s> on the right side of the screen. The <s>"node tree"</s> window is
It shows the structure of the entire effect, "Node" indicates particles. By editing this, you can edit the shape of this particle.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/02_nodetree.png">
<p>ノードツリーウインドウ</p>
</div>

When clicked, a large number of available windows will be displayed. Although it may be surprised if it is the first time,
only two windows are used in this chapter.

To edit the position of the <s>initial placement</s>, edit the parameters of the <s>"position" window</s>.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/02_position_en.png">
<p>位置ウインドウ</p>
</div>

Let's change the value of x at the position in the position window from 0 to 2.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/02_position_input_en.png">
<p>Change the value of x</p>
</div>

Then, the particle moved from the center to the outside.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/02_position_input_view.png">
<p>外側に移動</p>
</div>

### Make the particle move

It is not fun when the particle is frozen. Let's move the particle.

Effekseer has several ways to specify the position.

Although the position is fixed in the initial setting, there is a specification method that can specify speed and acceleration.

Click on the drop-down list in <s>the position window</s> and change from position to position, velocity, acceleration.
Then, a text box for entering velocity and acceleration is added to the position window.
You will be able to set particle velocity and acceleration, so you can move the particles.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/02_pva_en.png">
<p>位置・速度・加速度</p>
</div>

Let's enter 0.1 in the x direction velocity.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/02_pva_input_en.png">
<p>位置・速度・加速度</p>
</div>

Then, the particle began to jump out of the screen at high speed.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/02_pva.gif">
<p>移動するエフェクト</p>
</div>

Let's try to see how behavior changes by entering other numbers.

### Display multiple particles

There are little effects constructed of single particle.
Let's display multiple particles.

The number of particles is set to <s>the generation number in common windows</s>.
Increasing this number will generate a lot of particles.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/02_common_en.png">
<p>生成数</p>
</div>

Let's make <s>the number of generated numbers</s> 100.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/02_common_count_en.png">
<p>生成数を増やす</p>
</div>

Much particles are now generated.
However, as all the particles move in the same direction, the particles will be displayed overlapping.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/02_count.gif">
<p>生成数を増やす</p>
</div>

### パーティクルをランダムな方向に移動させる

When the particle movement direction is the same, the particles will be displayed overlapping.
So, let's move randomly for each particle.

Let's enter 0.1 for the xyz <s>amplitude of the position window speed</s>. In addition, we reset 0.1 which was input to center earlier to 0.

This means that the speed is randomly set between -0.1 and 0.1.
That is, the particles move to the entire periphery around (0, 0, 0).

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/02_random_input_en.png">
<p>ランダム</p>
</div>

Particles now move around the entire circumference.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/02_random.gif">
<p>ランダム</p>
</div>

### Shorten the time when particles are displayed

Although particles are displayed for a long time now, some effects are displayed for a short time, depending on the effect.
Let's shorten the display time.

There is a parameter called <s>Survival Time</s> in the common window.
Let's shorten this parameter. I entered 30 this time.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/02_life_input_en.png">
<p>生存時間</p>
</div>

If you make it smaller, particles will disappear soon.

<div align="center">

</div>

Finally, I tried to download the effect created in this chapter. <- ???

## Summary

This time I created multiple particles and made move.
In the next chapter, you will edit from a particle to look more like an effect.
