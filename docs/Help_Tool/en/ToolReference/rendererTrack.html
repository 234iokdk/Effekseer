		<h1>Render - Track</h1>
		
		<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
Drawing and parameters when "Track" is selected in drawing setting are explained.
</p>

<p>
When "Track" is selected, effects on continuously connected loci will be drawn.
</p>

<p>
The track is drawn by connecting all the children of a certain particle instead of drawing each particle. For example, if there are particles 1, 2, and 3 of the child of particle 0, a shape is drawn with a track drawn between 1, 2, and 3. The track is shaped like connecting the lines between each particle. Unlike the ribbon, the ribbon was influenced by the rotation and enlargement of the particle, but in the case of the track it is not influenced by them and always faces the camera.
