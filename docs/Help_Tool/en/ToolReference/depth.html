		<h1>Depth</h1>
		
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		Set the parameters for depth-of-direction processing.

		<h2>Parameter</h2>
		
		<h3>Z-Offset</h3>
		<p>
		Moves the particle position in the depth direction when it is drawn.
		This parameter affects drawing only.
		Only particles with this parameter are moved. Child's particles are not moved in Version 1.4.
		For example, when drawing a hit effect, this parameter can be used to prevent that the caracter clips the effect.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Is scaling invalid with Z offset</h3>

		<p>
Specifies whether the size of particles does not change when the distance from the camera is changed with movement by Z Offset.
		</p>
	
		<h3>Scaling Z-Offset</h3>

		<p>
Specifies whether Z-offset increases with particle's scale parameter.
		</p>
	
		<h3>Depth sort</h3>

		<p>
Specify whether particles belonging to the same node are sorted by the distance in the depth direction.
If this parameter is on, particles get a better appearance and processing becomes heavier.
		</p>

		<h3>Drawing priority</h3>

		<p>
Specify the drawing order between nodes. The higher this parameter, the later particles are drawn.
This parameter also affect a distortion.
If the drawing priority is less than 0, distortion distorts only the background. Distortion does not distorts between particles.
If the drawing priority is 0 or more, it distorts the background and particles with drawing priority less than 0.
		</p>

		<h3>Soft particle</h3>

		<p>
It is a parameter for a specific game engine. It is not reflected in Effekseer in version 1.4.
