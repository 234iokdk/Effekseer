		<h1>Render - Ribbon</h1>
		
		<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
Drawing and parameters when "Ribbon" is selected in drawing setting are explained.
</p>

<p>
When "Ribbon" is selected, effects on continuous ribbon are drawn.
</p>

<p>
Ribbon is not drawn for each particle, it connects all children of a certain particle and draws it.
For example, if there are particles 1, 2, and 3 of the child of particle 0, a shape like a ribbon drawn between 1, 2, and 3 is drawn. 
The ribbon is shaped like connecting the lines between (-0.5, 0, 0) and (0.5, 0, 0) of each particle.

		<h2>Parameter</h2>

		<h3>描画順</h3>
		<p>
Specify the order in which particles are drawn among particles generated from the same node.
In the order of generation, if the first generated particle is the first, in reverse order of generation, the first generated particle will be drawn last.
That is, in the order of generation, the drawing of the last generated particle is given priority over the first generated particle.
		</p>

		<h3>視点追従</h3>
		<p>
The shape of the ribbon is a line with a thickness connecting the lines connecting (- 0.5, 0, 0) and (0.5, 0, 0) points centered on the particle.
Normally, the direction of the line connecting the two points depends on the rotation of the particle, but it specifies whether to turn it toward the view side or not by rotating it.
		</p>

		<h3>全体色</h3>
		<p>
Specify the overall color of the ribbon.
		</p>

		<h3>頂点色</h3>
		<p>
Specify the color of each vertex of the ribbon.
		</p>

		<h3>頂点座標</h3>
		<p>
Specify the coordinates of each vertex of the ribbon. Only X coordinates can be specified here.
